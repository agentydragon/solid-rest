# Solid-Rest-Mem

A Solid-Rest plugin for virtual in-memory pods

This is a plugin for [Solid-Rest](https://github.com/solid/solid-rest) that handles in-memory virtual pods.  This plugin is best used through other libraries, notably [Solid Node Client](https://github.com/solid/solid-node-client) which combines the plugin with authenticated fetching in making a command-line or server-side app.

**Note** This library has not been upgraded to version 2.x yet, so is NOT usable at the moment.
