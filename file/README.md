# Solid-Rest-File

This is a plugin for [Solid-Rest](https://github.com/solid/solid-rest) that handles file system read and write.  This plugin is best used through other libraries, notably [Solid Node Client](https://github.com/solid/solid-node-client) which combines the plugin with authenticated fetching in making a command-line or server-side app.
